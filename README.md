# 20220870-Research-Repository
My very own research repository. I intend to use this to track my learning and thinking processes throughout my software development learning process. I want to treat it as a *digital garden* where ideas and understanding can be cultivated and grow over time.

It will contain research, thoughts and reflections on:
* my learning process
* code
* anything else I find interesting, confusing or difficult

### [Reflective Journal](https://github.com/6abrielle/20220870-research-repository/blob/main/reflective-journal.md)
*My reflective journal contains the most valuable parts of my learning journey so far and forms the bulk of my Research Repository assessment.*

Find my code [here](https://github.com/6abrielle/20220870-research-repository/tree/main/code).

### Software Development Fundamentals notes
*This section doesn't contain much reflection, but are my basic lecture notes that I will build up as my understandings expand and solidify. I intend for them to become something I can refer back to throughout my development journey.*
