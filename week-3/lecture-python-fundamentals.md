## Programming Language: Python

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:
* web development (server-side)
* software development
* mathematics
* system scripting

## What can Python do?
* can be used on a server to create web applications
* can be used alonside software to create workflows
* can connect to database systems and read and modify files
* can be used to handle big fata and perform complex mathematics
* can be used for rapid prototypling, or for production-ready software development

## Why Python?
* works on different platforms (Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc)
* has a simple syntax similae to the English language
* has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages
* python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written, meaning prototyping can be very quick
* python can be treated in a **procecural** way, an **object-oriented** way or a **functional way**

**pros** | **cons** 
--- | --- 
* designed to be intuitive and easy to program in (without sacrificing power)|* slower than "pure" (i.e. compiled) languages like C++
