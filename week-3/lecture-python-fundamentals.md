[Today's 1pm lecture Python Fundamentals will be expertly run by Dr. Sarmad Soomro and delivered via the teams channel.

He will introduce the pythonic versions of code that we have already used in Scratch: variables, data types, conditional statements, and operators. Just as we have used them in Scratch, these are the fundamental building blocks of programs. 

At first, it might feel a bit slower developing by writing strange symbols into a text editor, but as you dive deeper into coding you will come to see how powerful python can be. Much of python's strength comes from the thousands of libraries already developed for specific types of programs and problems.

Each library is likely to 'abstract away' a problem for you. You are often given a new set of functions which you can simply bring into your project and use.

Currently, there are more than 137,000 python libraries.

10 Python Libraries that feel illegal to know: OpenCV, Scikit-learn, NuPIC, Ramp, NumPy, Pipenv, TensorFlow, PyTorch, PyBrain, MILK, Keras, Dash, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Theano, SymPy, Caffe2.

Exercise for Thursday:

Get python working on your machine.
MVP: Thursdays class will involve you creating a folder for your own versions of demo code in your github research repository. If you're not sure what your github research repository is, review the requisite session here: Week 2 Session 2: Research Repositories. Getting more familiar with GitHub:  ask your local support lecturers, or your peers who have already started on this. 
Create a folder for code, then within that for python. So that the repository has a code/python path. 
Consider the basics of one python framework that you think is interesting to research further. 
import and use that framework in a basic way.
Reflect on this process in the reflections part of your repository:
did it work as expected?
Did you encounter troubles? 
add any experiments into a new folder in your repository code/python/[frame-work-name].]: #
