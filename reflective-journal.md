# Relective Journal

*Note: The reflections under question headings are generally responses to given prompts, although I have amended and arranged them to suit me. My own unprompted thoughs and reflections can be found in paragraphs under each section.

## Week 1
## *Visual Programming with Scratch*

### What is visual programming?
Visual programming is programming using visual expressions, rather than typing text. Users manipulate boxes and other graphics and arrange them to represent relations to each other. 

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language developed at MIT. It can help users understand programming logic, strategies for solving problems as well as principles for designing projects and communicating ideas. We used it for an introduction to programming, where we created a canonical "Hello World" program. For me, I think Scratch will be useful to understand some of the logic and concepts behind programming in a fun environment.

### What are some programming principles you have discovered?

### What is a variable?
A variable is a value that can change depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project you have made or remixed?

### What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped". In object-oriented programming it refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. A language that features polymorphism allows developers to program in the general rather than in the specific.

### Krebs Cycle of Creativity (Oxman, 2016)
Oxman argues that knowledge can no longer be ascribed to, or produced within disciplinary boundaries, but is entirely tangled. The below image is a map for four domains of creative expression--science, engineering, design and art.

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future development.
