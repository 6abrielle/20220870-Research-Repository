# Relective Journal

*Note: The reflections under question headings are generally responses to given prompts, although I have amended, arranged and added to them to suit me.*

## Week 1
## *Visual Programming with Scratch*

### What is visual programming?
Visual programming is programming using visual expressions, rather than typing text. Users manipulate boxes and other graphics and arrange them to represent relations to each other. 

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language developed at MIT. It can help users understand programming logic, strategies for solving problems as well as principles for designing projects and communicating ideas. We used it for an introduction to programming, where we created a canonical "Hello World" program. For me, I am hoping Scratch will be useful to understand some of the logic and concepts behind programming in a fun environment.

### What are some programming principles you have discovered?
At the moment I haven't discovered many programming principles. I should seek clarification about what is actually meant by programming principles. Are they conventions? Functions? Variables? I'm assuming they are approaches or concepts that are general across programming languages.

### What is a variable?
A variable is a value that can change depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Variables can be thought of as a **storage box**. You store information in them and you can change that information. Each variable stores just one piece of information. More specifically, different kinds of variables are called **data types** e.g. numeric, string, Boolean.
* *Goal: Use Canvas resources to try and understand different data types*

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project you have made or remixed?
Find my scratch projects [here](https://6abrielle.github.io/), along with the resources I used to complete them and reflective comments.

### What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped". In object-oriented programming it refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. I'm struggling to anchor this concept to any existing knowledge I have so I don't feel I understand properly what it means.

### Krebs Cycle of Creativity (Oxman, 2016)
Oxman argues that knowledge can no longer be ascribed to, or produced within disciplinary boundaries, but is entirely tangled. The below image is a map for four domains of creative expression--science, engineering, design and art. Oxman's goal is "to establish a tentative, yet holistic, cartography of the interrelation between these domains, where one realm can incite (r)evolution inside another; and where a single individual or project can reside in multiple dimensions."

### Which parts of the work went well?
The overview of the course is really important for me. I like to have as clear an idea of what is expected and how we will get there. So I found this portion of the lecture useful. I also did enjoy remixing the Scratch "Hello World" program, although I'm not sure I got very far.

### What didn't go so well?
I had a cold and couldn't attend the Thursday lab session this week. I did play around with Scratch at home on Thursday, but I didn't get very far beyond what was demonstrated on Monday. I think I would have felt more inspired and learnt from others if I was in class.

### How did you feel after this week's lessons?
I felt concerned and a bit discouraged because I had trouble understanding some of the basic Scratch concepts. Definitely some negative self-talk going on.

### On a 0-5 scale, how would you rate your experience and understanding?
3, because I didn't grasp a lot of the concepts about Scratch during Monday's session. I've since listened to the recording and done some more exploring with Scratch so feeling much better.

## Week 2
## *Making a Research Repository with GitHub*

### What is Git?
Git is an open-source version control system, which means that all code and the version history of code is stored locally on a developer's computer (my understanding is that it would be stored across the computers of all developers working on a specific project).

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is this website!! The cloud-based version of Git. Like Git, it's used to track changes and store code. 

### What is version control?
Version control involves tracking changes to software code. It's important in software because things often break. Track changes in Microsoft Word is a kind of version control. It's like the movie *Back to the Future*!

### How will we utilise GitHub?
We will create a repository on GitHub and treat it as a "digital garden" where we store thoughts, ideas, things we find difficult and research. We are aiming to collect evidence of our learning process as we go and observe how it grows. We will utilise markdown to format our repositories. In addition, the repository assessment is intended to be a way to introduce us to Git, which is used very seriously by developers, in a not so serious way.

### How do you intend to approach my Research Repository?
The idea of a "digital garden" really appeals to me (as would any nature-related metaphor!!). I would like to have a regular practice where I write down ideas and see them grow.

### On a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with the assessment?
2, because I am feeling quite anxious about using GitHub due to being completely unfamiliar with the software. I also can struggle with perfectionism in my work so I think it will be a real challenge to view the Repository as a flexible process that will change and be built upon. I know my instinctual response is to avoid the work until I feel like I can execute it well.
* *Goal: Think about exploring a different mindset when it comes to lerning and develop a new attitude.

### What is the relationship between technology and stress? Why do we need to be conscious of this?
Technology can cause stress in a lot of different ways:
* when we don't understand how to use it
* when it doesn't work as we expect it to or when we need it to
* constant access to work and distraction
Throughout this course, we want to find our own way of managing stress that technology can cause...

### Which parts of the work went well?
Following the directed steps to fork the example repository and create my own were well within my reach

### What did you struggle with?
I felt quite clueless during the mural explanation of Git/version control in the lecture. After rewatching the lecture, I understand a bit more about how and why teams of developers utilise version control systems.

## Week 3
## *Python Fundamentals*

### What is OOP?
**Object-Oriented Programming** is programming using languages that are oriented around the objects (things, nouns) that they are to process. For example, the statement "Fred walks" is written in the form `"fred.walks()"` instead of the functional form `"walks(fred)"` where the verb is emphasised. It has had a huge positive impact on how programs are now written.

### What is an IDE?
An **Integrated Development Environment** is an application/environment specifically designed for writing programs. Some programming languages require the use of an IDE. I have used Visual Studio Code with my Python coding. I also want to try out PyCharm.

### What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented wat or a functional way. It also runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it's written.

###Why are we learning Python?
A few reasons:
* it has a simple syntax similar to English
* it works across many different platforms
* it can be used for lots of different purposes: programming, web development, mobile application development, maths

### What is pair programming?
An **agile** software development technique where two programmers work together at one workstation. One person is the **driver** who writes the code while the other, the **observer** reviews each line of code as it is typed. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

## Week 4
## *Video Graph*

### What is functional fixedness?
A cognitive bias that impacts an individual's ability to be creative. The term is often used to describe why an individual develops an inability to use an object in more ways than it is traditionally intended to be used. Standard programming (where we try to recieve an expected output from a given input) contains an assumption about the underlying purpose of technology that can limit your creativity. We should be open to creating something unexpected i.e. **unexpect the expected**

I fall into a functional fixedness mindset when I am not confident to explore and push boundaries. In those cases, it can feel comforting to work within existing parameters.

### How can we avoid functional fixedness?
* abstract the problem--simplifying it to its essential elements before judging ideas
* draw inspiration from unexpected places
* opinions from different disciplines

## Week 5
## *Agile Rituals*

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
A **Minimum Viable Product** is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future development. In this course, Roman has given MVPs to set a clear intention and standard for work in a given week. It's helpful because it allows us to streamline our work process and focus on what's most important.
