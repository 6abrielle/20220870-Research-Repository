# Relective Journal

*My reflections are arranged under questions and headings, categorised by week and overarching reflections. They include responses to given prompts, which I have amended, arranged and added to to best suit my learning.*

## Week 1
## *Visual Programming with Scratch*

## What is programming?
Programming involves writing code that can eventually (through compiling) be understood and used by a computer. It refers to system and desktop software, rather than web-based applications. 

### What is visual programming?
Visual programming is programming using visual expressions, rather than typing text. Users manipulate boxes and other graphics and arrange them to represent relations to each other. 

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language developed at MIT. It can help users understand programming logic, strategies for solving problems as well as principles for designing projects and communicating ideas. We used it for an introduction to programming, where we created a canonical "Hello World" program. For me, I am hoping Scratch will be useful to understand some of the logic and concepts behind programming in a fun environment.

### What are some programming principles you have discovered?
At the moment I haven't discovered many programming principles. I should seek clarification about what is actually meant by programming principles. Are they conventions? Functions? Variables? I'm assuming they are approaches or concepts that are general across programming languages.

### What is a variable?
A variable is a value that can change depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Variables can be thought of as a **storage box**. You store information in them and you can change that information. Each variable stores just one piece of information. More specifically, different kinds of variables are called **data types** e.g. numeric, string, Boolean.
* *Goal: Use Canvas resources to try and understand different data types*

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project you have made or remixed?
Find my scratch projects [here](https://6abrielle.github.io/), along with the resources I used to complete them and reflective comments.

### What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped". In object-oriented programming it refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. I'm struggling to anchor this concept to any existing knowledge I have so I don't feel I understand properly what it means.

### Krebs Cycle of Creativity (Oxman, 2016)
Oxman argues that knowledge can no longer be ascribed to, or produced within disciplinary boundaries, but is entirely tangled. The below image is a map for four domains of creative expression--science, engineering, design and art. Oxman's goal is "to establish a tentative, yet holistic, cartography of the interrelation between these domains, where one realm can incite (r)evolution inside another; and where a single individual or project can reside in multiple dimensions."

### Which parts of the work went well?
The overview of the course is really important for me. I like to have as clear an idea of what is expected and how we will get there. So I found this portion of the lecture useful. I also did enjoy remixing the Scratch "Hello World" program, although I'm not sure I got very far.

### What didn't go so well?
I had a cold and couldn't attend the Thursday lab session this week. I did play around with Scratch at home on Thursday, but I didn't get very far beyond what was demonstrated on Monday. I think I would have felt more inspired and learnt from others if I was in class.

### How did you feel after this week's lessons?
I felt concerned and a bit discouraged because I had trouble understanding some of the basic Scratch concepts. Definitely some negative self-talk going on.

### On a 0-5 scale, how would you rate your experience and understanding?
3, because I didn't grasp a lot of the concepts about Scratch during Monday's session. I've since listened to the recording and done some more exploring with Scratch so feeling much better.

## Week 2
## *Making a Research Repository with GitHub*

### What is Git?
Git is an open-source version control system, which means that all code and the version history of code is stored locally on a developer's computer (my understanding is that it would be stored across the computers of all developers working on a specific project).

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is this website!! The cloud-based version of Git. Like Git, it's used to track changes and store code. 

### What is version control?
Version control involves tracking changes to software code. It's important in software because things often break. Track changes in Microsoft Word is a kind of version control. It's like the movie *Back to the Future*!

### How will we utilise GitHub?
We will create a repository on GitHub and treat it as a "digital garden" where we store thoughts, ideas, things we find difficult and research. We are aiming to collect evidence of our learning process as we go and observe how it grows. We will utilise markdown to format our repositories. In addition, the repository assessment is intended to be a way to introduce us to Git, which is used very seriously by developers, in a not so serious way.

### How do you intend to approach my Research Repository?
The idea of a "digital garden" really appeals to me (as would any nature-related metaphor!!). I would like to have a regular practice where I write down ideas and see them grow.

### On a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with the assessment?
2, because I am feeling quite anxious about using GitHub due to being completely unfamiliar with the software. I also can struggle with perfectionism in my work so I think it will be a real challenge to view the Repository as a flexible process that will change and be built upon. I know my instinctual response is to avoid the work until I feel like I can execute it well.
* *Goal: Think about exploring a different mindset when it comes to lerning and develop a new attitude.

### What is the relationship between technology and stress? Why do we need to be conscious of this?
Technology can cause stress in a lot of different ways:
* when we don't understand how to use it
* when it doesn't work as we expect it to or when we need it to
* constant access to work and distraction
Throughout this course, we want to find our own way of managing stress that technology can cause and learn to work with it. For me I think this will involve trying to break a habit of avoidance. I've never had a fight response to technology, but maybe a flight response!

### Which parts of the work went well?
Following the directed steps to fork the example repository and create my own were well within my reach however I have avoided exploring GitHub and adding to the repository so far. It is fun and interesting to be introduced to a completely new tool such as Git.

### What did you struggle with?
I felt quite clueless during the mural explanation of Git/version control in the lecture. After rewatching the lecture, I understand a bit more about how and why teams of developers utilise version control systems.

### How did you feel after this week's lessons?
A mixture of excited about being intoduced to new ideas and the approach to the assignment, but anxious that I won't be able to grasp important concepts.

### On a 0-5 scale, how would you rate your experience and understanding?
2.5, because I was able to follow the directions that were specifically outlined, but I haven't felt able to explore and do my own thing with GitHub yet.

## Week 3
## *Python Fundamentals*

### What is OOP?
**Object-Oriented Programming** is programming using languages that are oriented around the objects (things, nouns) that they are to process. For example, the statement "Fred walks" is written in the form `"fred.walks()"` instead of the functional form `"walks(fred)"` where the verb is emphasised. It has had a huge positive impact on how programs are now written.

[Introduction to object-oriented terms](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/objective-c-essential-training/introduction-to-object-orientation-terms?u=36492252)

### What is an IDE?
An **Integrated Development Environment** is an application/environment specifically designed for writing programs. Some programming languages require the use of an IDE. I have used Visual Studio Code with my Python coding. I also want to try out PyCharm.

### What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented wat or a functional way. It also runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it's written.

### Why are we learning Python?
A few reasons:
* it has a simple syntax similar to English
* it works across many different platforms
* it can be used for lots of different purposes: programming, web development, mobile application development, maths

### What is pair programming?
An **agile** software development technique where two programmers work together at one workstation. One person is the **driver** who writes the code while the other, the **observer** reviews each line of code as it is typed. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

### Are you struggling with this kind of traditional coding?
Yes. The I found it really hard to grasp the content in lecture format. My understanding increased the most by watching the lecture recording and working alongside Dr Soomro's examples using VS Code, and pausing the video as required. I've previously had success with practicing other languages using courses like what Codeacademy provides. The Canvas content is useful although intimidating. Even though I understand the concepts on Canvas, it is definitely challenging to figure out how to implement them in actual coding. 

### How did you feel after this week's lessons?
A bit disengaged from the course content because I admittedly didn't make as much of an effort as I could have with trying to forge my own way ahead with learning Python basics. I know there are a lot of resources out there that I could explore since I didn't grasp much of the lecture content the first time around. I also missed the Thursday session, which means I missed out on pair-programming and I struggled with the lab exercises on my own.

### On a 0-5 scale, how would you rate your experience and understanding?
2.5, for reasons explained above.

## Week 4
## *Video Graph*

### What is functional fixedness?
A cognitive bias that impacts an individual's ability to be creative. The term is often used to describe why an individual develops an inability to use an object in more ways than it is traditionally intended to be used. Standard programming (where we try to recieve an expected output from a given input) contains an assumption about the underlying purpose of technology that can limit your creativity. We should be open to creating something unexpected i.e. **unexpect the expected**

I fall into a functional fixedness mindset when I am not confident to explore and push boundaries. In those cases, it can feel comforting to work within existing parameters.

### How can we avoid functional fixedness?
* abstract the problem--simplifying it to its essential elements before judging ideas
* draw inspiration from unexpected places
* opinions from different disciplines

[Functional fixedness](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/functional-fixedness)

### Identify a bias mitigation technique for machine learning.
[A Suvey on Bias and Fairness in Machine Learning](https://github.com/6abrielle/20220870-research-repository/blob/main/week-4/A%20Survey%20on%20Bias%20and%20Fairness%20in%20Machine%20Learning.pdf)

The ideas of how bias is built into machine learning systems, and in techology we utilise in general is fascinating to me. I have a background in social sciences (sociology, politics and psychology) so I am really interested in how we can disrupt institutional biases. I'm really looking forward to learning how this manifests in technology we use. 
* *Goal: This article looks heavy going, so I look forward to looking into it at a later date.

### What is a graph?
In computer science, a graph is a collection of data, used to illustrate the flow of information from one dataset to another. The relationships can be complex and non-linear.

[Knowledge graphs in corporate use](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/data-science-foundations-knowledge-graphs/knowledge-graphs-in-corporate-use)

*Note: I was not present for Thursday's session and watched the recording of the video-train activity. The reflections below are based on what I learned from the recording, previous conversation about graphs with Roman, speaking with other students and my imagined experience of the activity.*

### What was the objective of the video train activity?
The objective of the exercise was to show how the nature of the relationship between apparrently unrelated datapoings to be used to produce a meaningful outcome. It is intended to be an artistic rendition of peer-to-peer communication within a network. In the exercise, the class gathered and each person filmed another until someone went out of frame, which ended the activity.
*Thanks to Cameron for the explanation and thoughts.*

### How did you feel as the subject of a video?
I imagine I would have felt odd, though I might only be visible on one person's screen, I am technically linked by some pathway to the phones of everyone who is taking part in the activity (as I imagine it).

## Week 5
## *Agile Rituals*

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
A **Minimum Viable Product** is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future development. In this course, Roman has given MVPs to set a clear intention and standard for work in a given week. It's helpful because it allows us to streamline our work process and focus on what's most important. I imagine it would be difficult or maybe unnecessary to describe to a group of 6 year olds, one because they aren't often dealing with complex tasks or problems in the same way adults are. Unnecessary because I think the MVP concept might naturally align with how a lot of children approach tasks--they might be less likely to overcomplicate a task in the first place, so long it is at an appropriate level for them.

### What did you learn from the circle meeting? How did you feel?
In class on Monday we experienced a agile style stand-up meeting. We each shared what we did on the weekend and an idea we have for our software project. I was quite nervous when I found out we were doing this, but as more people shared their answers, I began to feel calmer and inspired by the sharing of ideas. I think the purpose of the stand-up is to offer a quicker and more effective alternative to a traditional meeting. It was a bit long in the larger group but I imagine it would work well in smaller teams. I felt good about this exercise and it helped me come up with some ideas for my software project. It may have felt more meaningful if we were working on a shared, rather than individual software project.

### Did you have any blocks during this process? How did you overcome them?
I felt really unsure and had no idea what to do for my software project, but the sharing during the meeting encouraged some creative thinking and it felt quite supportive too. So the environment created by the stand-up and Roman's facilitation helped me overcome that block.

### What did you learn from the Marshmallow Challenge?
The exercise teaches important lessons about software development process and prototyping.

### Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?
There were a couple of points during this challenge where I felt a bit of frustration (mild and proportionate to the task). It came up in moments whern our group experienced communication difficulties about how to execute the activity. It made me consider sitting back and taking a less active role in the challenge. Our team overcame this when we realised we should start from the bottom and make a basic structure, before using any extra time to add to it. It seemed to illeviate a stress and the activity became more collaborative and fun after that.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
I didn't find anything tedious, it was fun and lighthearted. I would have liked a bit more of an explanation of the experiences and how they relate back to agile frameworks after the activities.

### How did you feel after this week's lessons?
Good, more engaged and connected with my classmates, as well as with the work. I feel like regular stand-ups could be really beneficial to the learning journeys of students, and provide accountability. A little worried about my software project but also a little inspired...more on that later.

### On a 0-5 scale, how would you rate your experience and understanding?
This week was a pretty solid 4.5. I like learning about people-focused frameworks like agile, and I love seeing how it works in action, so I feel confident about these concepts. I also feel confident to access other resources about agile methodologies as needed.

## Looking back: Final Reflections for the Assignment

## *Learning Strategies*

### Personal learning strategy
I really embarked on a terrible learning strategy for the tech support class. With the Canvas content, I became a little obsessed with going over it and taking notes in an extremely methodical way, which while did help me become familiar with the content, was quite tedious and took a lot of time. This is a fairly typical learning blunder for me. I've integrated new concepts like MVPs and timeboxing to develop a new strategy below.

> 1. Abstract the problem: define tasks in simple form
> 2. Define MVP
> 3. Set timeboxes
> 4. Take break and stretch hourly
> 5. Review and reflect on learning weekly, amend learning strategy accordingly
> 6. Show up
> 7. Cultivate an attitude of openness and curiosity

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
Timeboxing is a goal oriented technique that works on the assumption that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion". You work on an activity for a predetermined period of time, and attempt to limit the amount of time you spend on an activity. I have heard of and used time blocking before, but not timeboxing. As someone with ADHD, tasks without defined limits can seem to go on endlessly--highly engaged and doing too much work if I am interested, and not enough if I am not interested. I think this could be a really useful strategy for me and I look forward to implementing it.

## *Habits and Attitude*

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
This is an interesting question. I consider creativity and innovation to be one of my core values. As a tool to think logically... I'm not really sure. Maybe it can help logical thinking by figuring things out and learning in a personalised and novel way? I'm interested to hear other's thoughts on this.

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? What did it take?
The only thought I have on this is that it is much easier to gain mastery over things I really enjoy. So I encourage myself to find a perspective or approach which encourages enjoyment.

### Meditation and mindfulness
My favourite resource for mindfulness is Pema Chodron's [*When Things Fall Apart*](https://www.amazon.com/When-Things-Fall-Apart-Difficult/dp/1611803438). It's written specifically for those navigating difficult times, however the message is about **approaching struggles with openness and curiosity**. This can apply to all problems and struggles, and an idea I'd like to incorporate into my software learning strategy.

### Conscious listening
To listen consciously is to be intentionally present during communication between yourself and another while being aware of your own and the other's feelings and needs.

[Video: Conscious listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKayQthlwts&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)

### Fixed vs. growth mindset
![growth vs fixed mindset](https://assets.website-files.com/5e61c61d7b1e830be9d1c47a/5f6d8ebab07a96ab7f5feebf_Growth%20vs%20Fixed%20Mindset%20Infographic.png)

## *My Interests*

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
I'm interested in contunuing practicing markdown, HTML and JavaScript because I understand these are foundational tools for web-based development. I'm interested in web dev because I think web based applications can have a big impact for a large number of people and can be useful hand helpful for people in daily lives. Web based applications (along with mobile) are what I engage with most as well -- I don't tend to game or use many heavy duty computer programs in my day-to-day.

## *Refletception: Reflecting on the repository process*
I really like the concept behind this assignment. I hope to continue to add to this repository going forward. The biggest takeaway for me is the importance of learning as a process, and that documenting the process without self-judgement is more effective than seeking or *hoping* to develop a degree of mastery over really complex subject matter. As I mentioned previously, I have a tendency to avoid work when I don't feel confident or already have a degree of achievement in the area. This is part of a fixed mindset that I am trying to shift to a growth mindset. For this reason, I sometimes haven't added to my repository as I went, sometimes jotting down reflections on paper or in notion instead. I think this assignment has taught me a lesson in that regard, the version control aspect should be used to embrace the process and can be reflected on to see how far one has progressed. I also have enjoyed using markdown -- I have used markdown commands in *Notion* and also enjoyed learning HTML in the past. I do wish I had more code with thoughtful comments in my repository, but I'll add to this later on as I've found it a really useful learning process. I was a bit set back by my interpretation of the instruction to add code that inspires you. In my view, I didn't have enough coding knowledge to *feel* inspired by code alone. Taking another perspective, I'm somewhat excited by all the code I've encountered so far, because it's helping me understand new concepts.

## *Final thoughts on the course so far*
I can't say I would consider myself a developer yet, having only tried a few coding activities and just beginning to build up my knowledge about Python. I'm starting to understand that we are being taught skills to find our own creative path and process into development. If I could send a message to myself at the start of the course I would say dive into experiences and try things out and don't worry about failing, because it is part of learning. The hardest moments of this course have been feeling lost/confused during some of the lectures, particularly the Python lecture. However I'm starting to build confidence and notice that these skills can be learnt over time, and the real challenge is adjusting my attitude to learning as a whole. This includes cultivating a growth mindset and using creativity to find my own pathway into development. I'm enjoying the course more as it continues, and building confidence as I go.
