# Relective Journal

*Note: The reflections under question headings are generally responses to given prompts, although I have amended, arranged and added to them to suit me. My own unprompted thoughs and reflections can be found in paragraphs under each section. You can also find additional reflective comments throughout other parts of my repository.*

## Week 1
## *Visual Programming with Scratch*

### What is visual programming?
Visual programming is programming using visual expressions, rather than typing text. Users manipulate boxes and other graphics and arrange them to represent relations to each other. 

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a visual programming language developed at MIT. It can help users understand programming logic, strategies for solving problems as well as principles for designing projects and communicating ideas. We used it for an introduction to programming, where we created a canonical "Hello World" program. For me, I am hoping Scratch will be useful to understand some of the logic and concepts behind programming in a fun environment.

### What are some programming principles you have discovered?
At the moment I haven't discovered many programming principles. I should seek clarification about what is actually meant by programming principles. Are they conventions? Functions? Variables? I'm assuming they are approaches or concepts that are general across programming languages.

### What is a variable?
A variable is a value that can change depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Variables can be thought of as a **storage box**. You store information in them and you can change that information. Each variable stores just one piece of information. More specifically, different kinds of variables are called **data types** e.g. numeric, string, Boolean.
* *Goal: Use Canvas resources to try and understand different data types*

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project you have made or remixed?
Find my scratch projects [here](https://6abrielle.github.io/), along with the resources I used to complete them and reflective comments.

### What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped". In object-oriented programming it refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms. I'm struggling to anchor this concept to any existing knowledge I have so I don't feel I understand properly what it means.

### Krebs Cycle of Creativity (Oxman, 2016)
Oxman argues that knowledge can no longer be ascribed to, or produced within disciplinary boundaries, but is entirely tangled. The below image is a map for four domains of creative expression--science, engineering, design and art. Oxman's goal is "to establish a tentative, yet holistic, cartography of the interrelation between these domains, where one realm can incite (r)evolution inside another; and where a single individual or project can reside in multiple dimensions."

### Which parts of the work went well?
The overview of the course is really important for me. I like to have as clear an idea of what is expected and how we will get there. So I found this portion of the lecture useful. I also did enjoy remixing the Scratch "Hello World" program, although I'm not sure I got very far.

### What didn't go so well?
I had a cold and couldn't attend the Thursday lab session this week. I did play around with Scratch at home on Thursday, but I didn't get very far beyond what was demonstrated on Monday. I think I would have felt more inspired and learnt from others if I was in class.

### How did you feel after this week's lessons?
I felt concerned and a bit discouraged because I had trouble understanding some of the basic Scratch concepts. Definitely some negative self-talk going on.

### On a 0-5 scale, how would you rate your experience and understanding?
3, because I didn't grasp a lot of the concepts about Scratch during Monday's session. I've since listened to the recording and done some more exploring with Scratch so feeling much better.

## Week 2
## *Making a Research Repository with GitHub*

### How do you intend to approach my Research Repository?
The idea of a "digital garden" really appeals to me (as would any nature-related metaphor!!). I would like to have a regular practice where I write down ideas and see them grow.

### On a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with the assessment?
2, because I am feeling quite anxious about using GitHub due to being completely unfamiliar with the software. I also can struggle with perfectionism in my work so I think it will be a real challenge to view the Repository as a flexible process that will change and be built upon. I know my instinctual response is to avoid the work until I feel like I can execute it well.
* *Goal: Think about exploring a different mindset when it comes to lerning and develop a new attitude.

### What is the relationship between technology and stress? Why do we need to be conscious of this?
We want to find our own way of going with the flow, even when things don't work out

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future development. Roman has used the term to outline what is expected ... It is useful because it sets a clear standard and can help us avoid doing unhelpful or time consuming work and focus on the most... I don't know that you would need to explain it to 6 year olds because they would probably just do the MVP. Maybe I'd say soing something in the easiest way.

## Week 4

### What is functional fixedness?

### Unexpect the expected
So far we have followed a fairly straight forward path for programmers where we try to receive an expected output from a given input. This is the standard way that people build programs, and also the standard way that programming is taught. But this format itself contains an assumption about the underlying purpose of technology which can limit your creativity. Please read about "functional fixedness." (What is functional fixedness?Links to an external site.) 

What if the purpose is to create something unexpected?

### How did you feek as a subject of a video?

### Did you notice your ego?

### How are we evolving with this device?

### How could we draw this activity?

### Did you feel more attached to the phone than to your image?

### What was the objective for this week?
Please make sure you are up to date with the exercises provided so far: If you missed last week we got Pythonic with our programming practice with Sarmad who provided some work for you to attempt. 

### Which parts of the work went well?

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

### On a 0-5 scale, how would you rate your experience and understanding?

 At some point when you are not tired, please spend some time completely alone and quite and still.

Put away your phone, close your eyes.

Try to notice things but not change them. 

After you have been able to be still for as long as you can, then use your imagination to change the feelings.

Change the color, change the shape of things in your imagination.

Perhaps you will remember a time when you were very young, we will need that person.

This week we will take another turn.
