Embed hello world programme?

### What is Scratch?

Scratch is a visual programming language developed at MIT. We used it for an intro to programming.

### What is visual programming?

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?

## Week 2

## Session 1: Intro to Github

## Session 2: Making our Research Repository

### What is git?

### What is GitHub

Followed the instructions in Roman's Canvas announcement to make my repository. I'm really unfamiliar with this type of program/application so it's a bit to get used to.

Neri Oxman's Age of Entanglement: Creative version of Krebbs Cycle

MVP: Minimum viable product 

Our MVP this week is to create your Research Repository on GitHub.

Encouraged us to be generous about helping others. "There is no plagiarism in the sharing process, so be generous with each other"

If you do help someone else, what was it like? 
Did you learn anything while describing this to someone else?

Stretch goal: try creating a static site using GitHub itself by following this guide: https://docs.github.com/en/pages

Stretch goal: Add your scratch projects to a page. See announcement week 2 session 2 for instructions

## Week 3: Python Fundamentals

Session 1: Dr. Sarmad Soomro

Session 2: Exercises

1. Get python working on your machine.
2. MVP: Thursdays class will involve you creating a folder for your own versions of demo code in your github research repository. If you're not sure what your github research repository is, review the requisite session here: Week 2 Session 2: Research Repositories. Getting more familiar with GitHub:  ask your local support lecturers, or your peers who have already started on this. 
3. Create a folder for code, then within that for python. So that the repository has a code/python path. 
4. Consider the basics of one python framework that you think is interesting to research further. 
5. import and use that framework in a basic way.
6. Reflect on this process in the reflections part of your repository:
- did it work as expected?
- Did you encounter troubles? 
7. add any experiments into a new folder in your repository code/python/[frame-work-name]

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?

Although I often take time away from my screen, I tend not to plan when I do this. This week I spent a lot of time without taking breaks. I find this challenging because if I am focused on something and then I take time away, I often find I get distracted and don't go back to the original task. I would like to perservere with taking more regular breaks and developing the ability to direct my attention back to the task. I didn't stretch my body consciously at all.

Plan to do this

2 minute stretch routine
Tricep stretch
Upper body stretch
Shoulder stretch
Sitting trunk rotation
Neck stretch
Knee 
Hamstring


### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?

Timeboxing is a technique that can help people manage their time. It works by assigning fixed time "boxes" to an activity or task. 

I have heard of and used time blocking before, but not timeboxing. Time blocking... but timeboxing inclu
