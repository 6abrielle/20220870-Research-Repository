## Create a Research Repository with Git/GitHub

### GitHub
GitHub is a **version control** software that tracks all changes made within the program. This is important for software because things often break and need to be reverted back to a previous state. It is similar to the track changes function on Microsoft Word.

[What is GitHub? A Beginner's Introduction to GitHub](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/)

At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles:

* **version control**
* **Git**

### Version control
Version control is the practice of tracking and making changes to software code. Version control systems, such as GitHub, are software tools that help teams manage changes to source code over time.

Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress…

At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project. If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” source code.

Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.

With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.

Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code back into the main source code to make it official.

All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.

### Git
Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.

* **branches** are versions of your repository, or in other words, an independent line of development 
* **merging** takes your branch changes and implements them into the main branch

## How will we utilise GitHub?
We will create a **repository** on GitHub and treat it as a "digital garden" where we store thoughts, ideas, things we find difficult and research. We are aiming to collect evidence of our learning process as we go and observe how it grows. We will utilise **markdown** to format our repositories. 

### Repositories
A repository is a folder or collection of files for one project. It also contains all the version history.

### Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

### kebab-case
A programming naming convention where the developer replaces spaces between words with a dash. Use this for naming repository pages. Make them descrpitive.
