### *Hello, World. Kia ora, Taiao*
Hello world is a canonical program that displays the message "Hello, World" or similar. It is conventional that this is the first program one writes when learning a new language.

### Software development
Software development is an **inherently interdisciplinary pursuit** which covers:

* **art** to create new assumptions about the world and question existing assumptions
* **science** to gather knowledge about these assumptions
* **engineering** to implement
* **design** to communicate

### Krebs Cycle of Creativity (Oxman, 2016)
Oxman argues that knowledge can no longer be ascribed to, or produced within disciplinary boundaries, but is entirely tangled. The below image is a map for four domains of creative expression--science, engineering, design and art.

## Visual Programming with Scratch

[Video: Visual programming â€“ Introduction to Scratch, by Margo Tinawi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmfCwauN1c0&ab_channel=EuropeCodeWeek)

### Visual Programming
Visual programming is programming using visual expressions, rather than typing text. Users manipulate boxes and other graphics and arrange them to represent relations to each other.

### Scratch
Scratch is a visual programming language developed at MIT. It can help users understand programming logic, strategies for solving problems as well as principles for designing projects and communicating ideas. We used it for an introduction to programming, where we created a canonical "Hello World" program. For me, I think Scratch will be useful to understand some of the logic and concepts behind programming in a fun environment.

**Events**: An action that occurs as a result of the user or another source and that has significane for the program in use. For example a mouse click, movement or key stroke.

**Loops**: A sequence of instructions that repeat continually until a certain condition is reached.

**Conditionals**: Expressions that can be either true or false. They are "if, then" logic statements that modify how code is executed.

**Variables**: A value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.

**Operators**: Constructs defined within specific coding language that represent a specific action or process.

**Sprite**: A bitmap graphic that is integrated into a larger scene.

**Scripts**: A program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor.
