Save your workings, including what didn't work into your research repository. Reflect. Why didn't it work.

use these prompts as you're debugging and reflecting: What are you expecting? What are you getting? What have you tried so far?

Get python working on your machine.
MVP: Thursdays class will involve you creating a folder for your own versions of demo code in your github research repository. If you're not sure what your github research repository is, review the requisite session here: Week 2 Session 2: Research Repositories. Getting more familiar with GitHub:  ask your local support lecturers, or your peers who have already started on this. 
Create a folder for code, then within that for python. So that the repository has a code/python path. 
Consider the basics of one python framework that you think is interesting to research further. 
import and use that framework in a basic way.
Reflect on this process in the reflections part of your repository:
did it work as expected?
Did you encounter troubles? 
add any experiments into a new folder in your repository code/python/[frame-work-name]
